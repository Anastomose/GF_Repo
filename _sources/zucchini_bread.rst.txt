Zucchini Bread

Throw in a couple scoops of protein to make it a legit breakfast. If you have a lot of zucchini shred it all and then bag pre-measured portions for future loaves.

Laura's Sorghum Flour Blend
****************************

::

    1 1/2 C sorghum flour

    1 1/2 C potato starch

    1 C tapioca flour

Oven
-----

375 F for 45 to 50 minutes in a bread baking pan

Cool on a wire rack for 10-15 minutes then remove from pan and cool completely.

Instructions
-------------

Shred your zucchini. Slice lengthwise, remove seeds, then run through your shredder of choice. Peel or don't it's a personal choice. Set aside.

Lightly spray two standard loaf pans with cooking spray. Preheat oven to 375°.

To a large mixing bowl, add the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and allspice. Whisk together. Set aside.

In another large bowl, add the melted butter. Next add the sugar and whisk together to dissolve the sugar. Add the eggs, vanilla yogurt and lemon juice and whisk until combined.

Alternate adding some of the flour mixture and some of the shredded zucchini to the butter/sugar mixture, gently folding/stirring with a rubber spatula. I did this in three turns of flour and zucchini until all was gently stirred in.

Equally divide the batter between both loaf pans. 

Bake at 375° until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into center comes out with crumbs only, no wet batter, about 45-50 minutes. 

Cool in pan on cooling rack for 10-15 minutes. Remove from pan and let cool on wire rack until cool. Once cool, slice and serve, or wrap with foil and keep on counter for serving. Or wrap well with foil and place in a freezer bag and freezer for up to 6 months.
