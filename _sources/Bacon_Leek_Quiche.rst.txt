Instructions
-------------

Increase your oven temperature to 400 degrees F, or heat a second oven to this temperature.

Smear a little soft butter into the pie plate and up the sides.

In a large skillet over medium heat, fry the bacon until it is tender crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to a piece of foil or a paper plate. Wipe the bacon fat from the pan with some paper toweling.

Add the leek to the same pan and saut√© briefly until tender.

Grate the cheese into the bottom of the pie plate.

Scatter the bacon and then the leeks over the top.

In a small bowl, beat together the egg and cream. Season it with a bit of salt and pepper.

Pour the cream and egg mixture over the top of the bacon, leeks, and cheese.

Arrange the asparagus spears over the top and nestle them into the egg and cream.

Bake for 30 minutes, or until slightly puffed and golden.
