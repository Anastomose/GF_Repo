Instructions

Prepare Carnitas
*****************

Place the pork in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot w/ orange juice, lime juice, garlic, cumin, salt and enough water to just barely cover the meat.

Bring the pot to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer uncovered for two hours. Don’t touch the meat.

After two hours, increase the heat to medium-high and while occasionally stirring and turning the pieces, continue to cook for about 45 minutes, or until all of the liquid has evaporated

Let pork sizzle in its own fat long enough to brown at the edges, turn pieces gentlyonly as needed to prevent singes.

When pork has browned on both sides, it’s ready. Shred it and prepare for the bowl.

Add cilantro, lime juice and salt. Stir.

Prepare Chipotle Mayo

Prepare Bowl
**************

Combine everything in a bowl, layering upward from rice and beans and finishing with chipotle mayo.
