Pineapple Fried Rice
-------------------------

Ingredients
-----------

:: 


    2 T sesame or peanut oil

    2 eggs, beaten

    2 cups chopped fresh pineapple

    1 large red bell pepper

    1 bunch green onions diced

    2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced

    3/4 cup chopped raw, unsalted cashews

    2 cups cooked rice

    1 - 2  T tamari (season to taste)

    1 T sriracha

    1 lime    

    Fresh cilantro

Instructions
------------

1. Heat a large wok, cast iron skillet or non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat and place an empty serving bowl nearby. Once the pan is hot enough that a drop of water sizzles on contact, add 1 teaspoon oil. Pour in the eggs and cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggs are scrambled and lightly set. Transfer the eggs to the empty bowl. Wipe out the pan if necessary with a paper towel (be careful, it's hot!).

2. Add one tablespoon of oil to the pan and add the pineapple and red pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid has evaporated and the pineapple is caramelized on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes. 

3. Add the green onion and garlic. Cook, while stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds or longer. Transfer the contents of the pan to your bowl of eggs.    

4. Add the remaining two teaspoons of oil to the pan. Pour in the cashew and cook, stirring constantly, until the cashews smell fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the rice to the pan and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is hot, about 3 minutes.

5. Pour the contents of the bowl back into the pan and stir to combine. Once the contents are warmed through, remove the pan from heat. 

6. Season to taste with tamari and siracha to taste. Squeeze the juice of Â½ of a lime over the dish and stir to combine. 

7. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to individual serving bowls and garnish with a sprinkling of torn cilantro leaves, with jars of chili garlic sauce or sriracha on the side.

Notes
-----

Chilled leftover rice works best, but freshly cooked is also fine.
