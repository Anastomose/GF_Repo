Power Salad -- Chopped Thai Salad with Sesame Garlic Dressing
-------------------------------------------------------------

Ingredients
-----------

**For the dressing:**

::

    1/3 cup canola oil

    3 cloves garlic, peeled

    3 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce

    2 tablespoons water

    2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar

    2 tablespoons honey

    1 tablespoon sesame oil

    1 tablespoon lemongrass paste

    a squeeze of lime juice

**For the salad:**

::


    16 ounces frozen shelled edamame

    5-6 cups baby kale

    3 large carrots

    2 bell peppers (1 red, 1 yellow)

    1 cup cilantro leaves

    3 green onions

    3/4 cup Thai Lime and Chili Cashews

Instructions
------------

1. Puree all the dressing ingredients in a food processor until smooth. Taste and adjust to fit your preferences. Transfer to a dressing jar and rinse the food processor out for use later.

2. Cook the edamame by boiling it for 3-5 minutes in a pot of boiling water. Drain and allow it to cool.

3. Slice up the kale, carrots, peppers, cilantro leaves, and green onions into thin strips or shreds.

4. Place the cooked edamame in the food processor and pulse 5 times to get a minced texture. Transfer to a bowl and repeat the same process for the cashews.

5. Toss the kale, carrots, peppers, cilantro, green onions, edamame, and cashews together until well combined. Drizzle with the dressing, toss gently a few times, and serve immediately.

Notes
-----

The salad will stay fresh longer if you store the dressing separately from the salad ingredients, tossing them together just before serving.

Agave nectar or sugar would work in place of the honey for vegans.
