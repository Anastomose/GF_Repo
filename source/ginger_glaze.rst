Ingredients
---------------

::

    3 T low-sodium soy sauce

    1 T rice vinegar

    2 t minced garlic

    2 t fresh ginger (grated)

    1 t honey

    1/2 t sriracha


Instructions
------------

In a small saucepan, stir together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, and ginger. 

Bring to a simmer over medium high, then remove from heat.

Stir in the honey and chili paste. 

Apply to salmon, steak or other protein of choice on the non-heat side so it doesn't burn. The sauce will go well applied directly to the cooked dish as well.
