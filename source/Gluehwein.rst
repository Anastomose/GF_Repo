Gluehwein
--------------------

Because you're European and like to drink in the snow.

Ingredients
-----------

::

    3/4 C Water

    3/4 C sugar -- can be less

    1 cinnamon stick

    1 orange

    10 cloves

    Bottle red wine

Instructions
------------

In a saucepan, combine the water, sugar, and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer.

Halve the orange and juice into concentrate, then spike with cloves and add to simmering mix. 

Continue simmering for 30 minutes, until volume is reduced and the mix becomes thick and syrupy. This is enough concentrate for about 4 servings.

To make the full gluehwein add a bottle of red wine and heat just until it begins to steam. *Do not overheat or boil.* 

Serve hot in mugs.
