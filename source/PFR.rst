Ingredients
-----------

::


    1 package of Aidell's Hawaiian Sausage

    2 T sesame or peanut oil

    2 eggs, beaten

    2 cups chopped fresh pineapple

    1 large red bell pepper

    1 bunch green onions diced

    2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced

    3/4 cup chopped raw, unsalted cashews

    2 cups cooked rice

    1 - 2  T tamari (season to taste)

    1 T sriracha

    1 lime

    Fresh cilantro

Instructions
------------

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 teaspoon oil. 

Once the pan is hot pour in the eggs and cook scrambled style. Transfer the eggs to an empty bowl.

Chop the sausage and brown in a separate skillet, reduce heat to low.

Add one tablespoon of oil to the (still hot) pan and add the pineapple and red pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid has evaporated and the pineapple is caramelized on the edges.

Add the green onion and garlic, reduce heat slightly and cook while stirring until fragrant. Transfer the contents of the pan to your bowl of eggs. 

Add the remaining two teaspoons of oil to the pan. Pour in the chopped cashew and cook. Add the rice, and other cooked ingredients back into the pan and stir to combine until everything is heated through. 

Turn down the heat.

Add tamari and siracha to taste. Squeeze the lime over the dish and stir to combine.

Garnish with a sprinkling of chopped cilantro leaves.

Notes
-----

Chilled leftover rice works best, but freshly cooked is also fine.
