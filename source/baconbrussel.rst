Bacon Brussel Sprout Salad
----------------------------

Ingredients
-----------

::

    1 lemon
    1 orange
    1 large shallot, minced
    1/2 cup olive oil
    salt and pepper
    6 slices cooked bacon, crumbled or chopped
    4 dozen brussel sprouts
    1 cup almonds
    1 cup grated Pecorino-Romano cheese

Instructions
------------

1. Cook and crumble the bacon.

2. Squeeze the juice of the lemon and orange into a large bowl with the shallots. Pour the oil into the bowl in a steady stream, whisking to form an emulsion (it should appear more creamy and less transparent). Season generously with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use.

3. Using a mandoline, shave the brussel sprouts (not including the stems) into thin slices to make a shredded/slaw texture. I rinsed and dried mine again after shaving them just to be sure they were totally clean.

4. Place the almonds in a food processor and pulse until chopped coarsely. Add Â¾ of the almonds, cheese, and bacon to the shredded brussel sprouts; toss to combine.

5. When ready to serve, toss with the dressing and sprinkle remaining almonds, cheese, and bacon over the top.

6. If needed, add a few more tablespoons of olive oil and toss.
