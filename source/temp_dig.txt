Potato Leek Soup
Ingredients:

    2 tablespoons butter
    2 large leeks, whites and pale green parts only, sliced and rinsed well
    4 large Idaho potatoes, peeled and diced into cubes
    4 cups chicken stock
    1/2 cup heavy cream
    Salt and pepper to taste (I used white pepper)
    2 teaspoons white truffle oil (optional)
    Fresh chives for garnish (optional)

Directions:

    In a large pot with a lid, melt down your butter and add your leeks. Saute leeks until soft, about eight minutes.
    Add potatoes and stir together well. Add stock and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down heat to a simmer and cover pot.
    Continue cooking for 20-30 minutes (until potatoes are tender).
    Carefully blend soup in the blender (or use an emulsion blender) and puree to a desired consistency. Stir in the cream, salt and pepper to taste.
    If using white truffle oil, stir it in at the very end before serving. Garnish with fresh chives and serve with homemade croutons or crusty bread.

Salted Caramel Frosting
Salted Caramel Frosting

    1/2 cup (1 stick) salted butter
    1 cup packed dark brown sugar
    1/3 cup heavy cream
    1/4 tsp salt
    2-3 cups powdered sugar, sifted

Directions:

Start with the frosting: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Once melted, add brown sugar and heavy cream. Stir constantly over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Add salt. Allow to bubble for exactly 2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Beat in powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, until you reach desired consistency.

Crustless Bacon and Leek Quiche
Ingredients:
Softened butter for the pie plate, about 2 t.
½ pound good bacon, diced
1 small leek, trimmed of its hairy and darker green fibrous ends, diced, and washed well
¼ pound Gruyere or Emmenthaler cheese, grated
1 medium bunch of fat asparagus spears, with their woody ends snapped off and washed
…
5 eggs
1 ½ c. heavy cream
a pinch of salt and pepper

Method:

    Increase your oven temperature to 400 degrees F, or heat a second oven to this temperature.

    Smear a little soft butter into the pie plate and up the sides.

    In a large skillet over medium heat, fry the bacon until it is tender crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to a piece of foil or a paper plate. Wipe the bacon fat from the pan with some paper toweling.

    Add the leek to the same pan and sauté briefly until tender.

    Grate the cheese into the bottom of the pie plate.

    Scatter the bacon and then the leeks over the top.

    In a small bowl, beat together the egg and cream. Season it with a bit of salt and pepper.

    Pour the cream and egg mixture over the top of the bacon, leeks, and cheese.

    Arrange the asparagus spears over the top and nestle them into the egg and cream.

    Bake for 30 minutes, or until slightly puffed and golden.

Bacon and Brussel Sprout Salad
Ingredients

    1 lemon
    1 orange
    1 large shallot, minced
    ½ cup olive oil
    salt and pepper
    6 slices cooked bacon, crumbled or chopped
    4 dozen brussel sprouts
    1 cup almonds
    1 cup grated Pecorino-Romano cheese

Instructions

    Cook and crumble the bacon.
    Squeeze the juice of the lemon and orange into a large bowl with the shallots. Pour the oil into the bowl in a steady stream, whisking to form an emulsion (it should appear more creamy and less transparent). Season generously with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use.
    Using a mandoline, shave the brussel sprouts (not including the stems) into thin slices to make a shredded/slaw texture. I rinsed and dried mine again after shaving them just to be sure they were totally clean.
    Place the almonds in a food processor and pulse until chopped coarsely. Add ¾ of the almonds, cheese, and bacon to the shredded brussel sprouts; toss to combine. When ready to serve, toss with the dressing and sprinkle remaining almonds, cheese, and bacon over the top. If needed, add a few more tablespoons of olive oil and toss.

    1 Roma tomato, diced
    3/4 cup canned corn kernels, drained
    3/4 cup canned black beans, drained and rinsed
    1/4 cup diced red onion
    1/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
    1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
    1/4 cup Ranch dressing
    1/4 cup BBQ sauce
    1/4 cup tortilla strips

Instructions

    Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat.
    Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper, to taste. Add to skillet and cook, flipping once, until cooked through, about 3-4 minutes per side. Let cool before dicing into bite-size pieces.
    To assemble the salad, place romaine lettuce in a large bowl; top with chicken, tomato, corn, beans, onion and cheeses. Pour Ranch dressing and BBQ sauce on top of the salad and gently toss to combine.
    Serve immediately, topped with tortilla strips.
